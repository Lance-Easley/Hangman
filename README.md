# Side Project
This is my repository for my "Hangman" project, 
the third project that I made during Base Camp Coding Academy.

## Hangman
Hangman was one of my more complicated programs at the time. 
Hangman_words.py is a list of 250 words that the program can choose from. 
Hangman_graphic.py contains the "drawings" for the game. 
Hangman.py is the program to run. 
It determines the number of letters in the choosen word and allows the player to guess each letter.

**Note:** This program was made before I understood `for` loops.
